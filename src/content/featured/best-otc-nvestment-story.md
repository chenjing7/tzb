Sometimes outstanding investment results come from unknown stocks.  
有时，最出色的投资回报，竟来自于那些鲜为人知的股票。

Best Lock Corporation is a great example.  
百思锁公司（Best Lock Corporation）就是一个绝佳案例。

The company no longer exists and hasn’t traded publicly in over 20 years. Even when it did trade, few people knew about it. It was obscure, illiquid, family controlled, boring, and far off-the-beaten path.  
这家公司早已不存在，并且已有二十多年未曾公开交易。即使在交易时，也鲜有人知。它名不见经传、流动性差、由家族控制、业务乏味，远离主流市场。

Most investors wouldn’t bother with such a stock.  
多数投资者甚至懒得理会这样的股票。

But Best Lock returned around 20% annually from 1980 to 2003 (ignoring dividends).  
然而，从1980年到2003年，百思锁的年化回报率高达约20%（不含分红）。

A $100,000 investment would have turned into nearly $8 million.  
十万美元的投资最终变成了近八百万美元。

#### Martin Nelson Jr. 小马丁·尼尔森

Martin Nelson Jr. runs Martin Nelson & Company (MN&C)—a Seattle-based investment advisor and broker-dealer.  
小马丁·尼尔森是西雅图投资顾问公司 Martin Nelson & Company（MN&C）的负责人。

For those interested in investing in obscure stocks, Martin’s Best Lock story is a great case study.  
对于想要投资冷门股票的人来说，马丁关于百思锁的故事是一个极佳的案例研究。

It has everything you’d want in such a story: a deeply discounted stock, a boring old business, lost shareholders, activism, family drama, appraisal rights.  
这个故事具备所有你能想到的元素：极度折价的股票、无趣但稳定的传统生意、失联的股东、积极行动主义、家族剧变，以及股东估价权。

Those who know Martin might know the story. It has been shared over intimate dinners and cocktail parties. It has never been told publicly to my knowledge.  
认识马丁的人或许听过这个故事，在私人晚宴和鸡尾酒会上悄悄流传。据我所知，它从未被公开讲述过。

I sat down with Martin and heard him recount this incredible story firsthand, and he has agreed to let me share it here.  
我亲自向马丁听取了这段惊人的经历，并获得了他的许可在此分享。


#### Making Markets 做市

MN&C started making a market in Best Lock (BLOC) in the mid-1970s.  
1970年代中期，MN&C 开始为百思锁（BLOC）做市。

Market makers provide bids and offers on select stocks, facilitating trading and liquidity. They earn a profit on the spread (the price between the bid and offer). (Here’s the full FINRA definition for those interested: [6420\. Definitions | FINRA.org](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/6420).)  
做市商为特定股票提供买入价和卖出价，促进交易和流动性。他们通过价差（买入价和卖出价之间的价格）赚取利润。（如果您对此感兴趣，可以查看美国金融业监管局 (FINRA) 的完整定义： [6420。定义 | FINRA.org](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/6420) 。）

The mid-1970s was a good time to find bargains, and BLOC certainly looked like a bargain. **It was trading for around 3-5x earnings and a discount to book value**.  
20 世纪 70 年代中期是寻找廉价股票的好时机，而 BLOC 看起来确实很划算。 **当时它的市盈率约为 3-5 倍，且低于账面价值** 。

Best Lock was a simple business. It designed, manufactured, and marketed lock mechanisms, primarily for doors.  
百思锁是一家业务简单的公司，主要设计、生产和销售门锁。

![](https://joekraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Best-lock-door-handle.webp)

So MN&C was making a market in the stock, matching buyers and sellers and earning a spread. Martin was also buying shares for his clients and himself as he could.  
因此，MN&C 为这只股票做市，撮合买家和卖家，赚取价差。马丁也尽可能地为客户和自己买入股票。

But Best Lock was peculiar.  
但百思锁却很奇特。

The annual report showed over 4,000 shareholders of record, yet MN&C was only getting a few orders a year.  
年度报告显示，MN&C 拥有超过 4,000 名登记股东，但每年仅收到少量订单。

**Where were all the shareholders and why wasn’t there more volume in the stock?  
所有股东都在哪里？为什么股票交易量没有增加？**

Martin flew to the company’s headquarters in Indianapolis to view a shareholder list. It was about two inches thick and listed all 4,000 stockholders.  
马丁飞到印第安纳波利斯的公司总部查看了一份股东名单。这份名单大约有两英寸厚，列出了所有 4000 名股东。

**But there was a problem with the list.  
但这份名单存在一个问题。**

Many of the addresses in the shareholder register were wrong.  
股东登记册中的许多地址都是错误的。

Most holders were from Seattle (where the company was founded), and **Seattle changed their directional scheme for street names in 1961**.  
大多数持有人来自西雅图（该公司成立的地方）， **西雅图于 1961 年改变了街道名称的方向方案** 。

Martin knew this because he was a kid in Seattle when the ordinance passed.  
马丁知道这一点，因为当该法令通过时，他还是个孩子，生活在西雅图。

Here are some examples of address changes:  
以下是地址变更的一些示例：

**The company hadn’t updated the old addresses on its books.  
该公司尚未更新其账簿上的旧地址。**

Martin then asked to see a list of shareholders who had cashed the most recent dividend check. This list was less than half the size of the full shareholder list.  
马丁随后要求查看最近一次兑现股息支票的股东名单。这份名单的人数还不到全部股东名单的一半。

**He discovered that some holders hadn’t been cashing their dividend checks for years.  
他发现一些持有人多年来一直没有兑现股息支票。**

What’s going on here?  
这里发生了什么？

#### Lost Shareholders 失散的股东

Best Lock was founded in Seattle in 1922 by Frank E. Best.  
百思锁由 Frank E. Best 于 1922 年在西雅图创立。

Like many startups in the 1920s, shares were sold door-to-door to average citizens.  
与 20 世纪 20 年代的许多初创公司一样，股票也是挨家挨户地卖给普通民众。

When the Depression hit, Best Lock stopped paying dividends. Then the company moved its headquarters from Seattle to Indianapolis to be closer to suppliers and customers.  
大萧条来袭时，百思锁停止派发股息。随后，该公司将总部从西雅图迁至印第安纳波利斯，以便更靠近供应商和客户。

Let’s get into the mind of the average shareholder.  
让我们来了解一下普通股东的想法。

They bought the stock from a door-to-door salesman during the roaring 1920s. Then the Great Depression came along. No more dividends. Boarded up factory. Most of these fly-by-night stock listings from the 20s were down 95%+.  
他们在繁荣的 20 世纪 20 年代从上门推销员那里买到了股票。后来大萧条来了。没有股息了。工厂也关门歇业了。20 年代上市的这些不靠谱的股票大多下跌了 95% 以上。

**The thing must be worthless, right?  
这东西肯定一文不值吧？**

It makes sense why shareholders would write off their Best Lock investment. There were other, more pressing things to worry about.  
股东们放弃对百思锁的投资是有道理的。还有其他更紧迫的事情需要担心。

By the late 1970s when Martin was looking at the shareholder list, nearly 50 years had passed and the company was again profitable, growing, and paying dividends.  
到了 20 世纪 70 年代末，当马丁查看股东名单时，已经过去了近 50 年，公司再次盈利、发展并支付股息。

After going through the Depression, World War II, moving to Indianapolis, and the Seattle address overhaul, many shareholders had been lost.  
在经历了大萧条、第二次世界大战、搬迁至印第安纳波利斯以及西雅图地址变更之后，许多股东已经流失。

In many cases, **heirs had no idea they inherited the stock.**  
在许多情况下， **继承人并不知道自己继承了股票。**

#### Door Knocking 敲门

Martin knew he had an opportunity on his hands: **an illiquid stock with lost shareholders trading for a low-single-digit P/E multiple.**  
马丁知道他手上有一个机会： **一只流动性差、股东流失的股票，其市盈率只有个位数。**

He decided to form a new company dedicated to finding the rightful owners of these shares. This involved genealogical research and many hours spent at the local library and county records office.  
他决定成立一家新公司，致力于寻找这些股份的合法所有者。这涉及家谱研究，并在当地图书馆和县档案馆花费了大量时间。

Over time, **he was able to find dozens of holders who had no idea they owned Best Lock shares.**  
随着时间的推移， **他找到了数十名不知道自己持有百思锁股票的股东。**

Martin would contact these shareholders (many of whom were second and third generation owners) and say something along the lines of:  
马丁会联系这些股东（其中许多人是第二代和第三代所有者）并说类似这样的话：

*“I know of an asset you own that you don’t know you own. It’s worth X amount of dollars and I will put you in touch with it. My fee will be one third of the total value. You don’t have to pay anything out of pocket. I will even pay* ***your*** *attorney to verify that all of this is real and correct.”*  
*我知道您拥有一项您自己并不知情的资产。它价值 X 美元，我会帮您联系。我的费用是总价值的三分之一。您无需自掏腰包。我甚至会聘请**您的**律师来验证这些信息的真实性和准确性。*

This was a compelling proposition.  
这是一个令人信服的提议。

Imagine someone knocking on your door and offering thousands of dollars for an asset you didn’t know you owned.  
想象一下，有人敲你的门并愿意出数千美元购买你不知道自己拥有的资产。

Few said no.  
很少有人说不。

Best Lock was trading for around $30 per share at the time, so after his one third fee Martin was buying the shares for around $20. **This equated to 2-3x earnings.**  
当时百思锁的股价约为每股 30 美元，扣除三分之一的费用后，Martin 以每股 20 美元左右的价格买入了这些股票。 **这相当于 2-3 倍的收益。**

Over time, Martin was able to acquire roughly 15% of the float (shares not held by the Best family) using this approach.  
随着时间的推移，马丁通过这种方式成功收购了大约 15% 的流通股（贝斯特家族未持有的股份）。

#### Family Dynamics 家庭纷争

This is where the story takes a surprising turn.  
故事就在这里发生了令人惊讶的转折。

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Best Lock was run by Walter Best, the son of founder Frank Best. Walter had four sons who also worked in the business. **Together, the Best family controlled a little over half of the outstanding voting interest in Best Lock.**  
20 世纪 80 年代至 90 年代初，百思锁由创始人弗兰克·贝斯特的儿子沃尔特·贝斯特经营。沃尔特的四个儿子也都在公司工作。 **贝斯特家族合计控制着百思锁一半以上的流通投票权。**

Martin’s entrepreneurial buying effort (as well as some other well-known value investors getting involved) had caused a bit of a stir in the Best family.  
马丁的创业收购行为（以及其他一些知名价值投资者的参与）在贝斯特家族中引起了一些轰动。

As Martin recalls, one of Walter’s sons, Russell (along with the corporate attorney), convinced Walter that it was a good idea for the family to consolidate ownership in the next generation. By their reasoning, this would help fend off any unfriendly outside shareholders.  
马丁回忆说，沃尔特的一个儿子拉塞尔（以及公司律师）说服沃尔特，让家族将所有权交到下一代手中是个好主意。他们认为，这将有助于抵御任何不友好的外部股东。

Walter agreed, and **Best Lock loaned Russell the money to buy his father’s shares in the business.**  
沃尔特同意了，于是**百思锁借钱给拉塞尔，让他购买他父亲在公司中的股份。**

This transaction gave Russell Best outright control of Best Lock.  
此次交易使拉塞尔·贝斯特完全控制了百思锁。

**A week later, Russell dismissed his father and brothers from the company**.  
**一周后，拉塞尔将他的父亲和兄弟从公司解雇** 。

He made himself Chairman/CEO and he and his wife were the sole directors of the company.  
他自任董事长/首席执行官，他和他的妻子是该公司的唯一董事。

What’s interesting is that **the Best family already had absolute control of the corporation.**  
有趣的是， **贝斯特家族已经对该公司拥有绝对的控制权。**

Even before Russell took over, there was nothing Martin Nelson or any other minority shareholder could do to force change on Best Lock, assuming the family voted their collective shares in unison.  
即使在拉塞尔接手之前，马丁·尼尔森或任何其他少数股东都无法迫使百思锁做出改变，前提是该家族成员一致投票。

#### The Reverse Split Takeout 反向拆分外卖

A few years after taking full control, Russell decided to take the company private.  
在完全控制公司几年后，拉塞尔决定将公司私有化。

He did this through a series of reverse splits in 1998 that effectively cashed everyone out for $525 per share—a high-single-digit multiple of earnings. The stock had been trading for $300 prior to the reverse splits, so the cash out price was a nice **75% premium**.  
他在 1998 年通过一系列反向拆股实现了这一目标，这些拆股实际上以每股 525 美元的价格套现了所有股票——市盈率高达个位数。在反向拆股之前，该股的交易价格为 300 美元，因此套现价格**溢价高达 75%**。

A group of minority shareholders dissented and perfected their appraisal rights in Delaware—arguing that Russell Best had violated his fiduciary duty, and that the $525/share figure was too low for a company of Best Lock’s caliber.  
一群少数股东表示反对，并在特拉华州完善了他们的评估权——他们认为拉塞尔·贝斯特违反了他的信托责任，并且对于百思锁这种规模的公司来说，每股 525 美元的价格太低了。

#### The Sale of Best Lock  百思锁的出售

At some point in the legal process, Russell decided to explore a sale of the entire company.  
在法律程序的某个阶段，拉塞尔决定探索出售整个公司。

Stanley Black & Decker stepped up to the plate and offered $310 million to buy Best Lock (more than triple the reverse split takeout price). Final payout for the dissenting shareholders was received in April 2003.  
史丹利百得公司（Stanley Black & Decker）主动出击，出价 3.1 亿美元收购百思锁（价格是反向拆分收购价的三倍多）。反对股东的最终赔付于 2003 年 4 月到账。

资料来源：印第安纳波利斯商业杂志第 24 卷，第 5 期（2003 年 4 月 14 日）

Those initial shares Martin was buying for $20 in 1980 turned into $1,597 in 2003, **good for** **a CAGR of 20% before dividends over the 23-year period.**  
马丁在 1980 年以 20 美元的价格购买的初始股票在 2003 年变成了 1,597 美元， **在 23 年期间的股息前的复合年增长率为 20%** **。**

Not bad for an unknown thinly traded Pink Sheet stock shrouded in family drama.  
对于一只名不见经传、交易清淡、深陷家庭纠纷的粉单市场股票而言，这还不错。

#### Postscript 后记

*A few author notes:一些作者注释：*

*\-There were three different publicly traded vehicles related to Best Lock operating company: Frank E. Best, Best Universal Lock, and Best Lock Corporation. There was circular ownership which made the situation somewhat complicated (and perhaps contributed to the undervaluation). I only discussed Best Lock Corp. in this article to keep things simple. All three stocks worked out well for shareholders.  
\- 与百思锁运营公司相关的上市公司有三家：Frank E. Best、Best Universal Lock 和 Best Lock Corporation。存在循环所有权，这使得情况有些复杂（或许也导致了估值过低）。为了简单起见，我在本文中只讨论了 Best Lock Corp。这三只股票都对股东有利。*

*\-Best family members ousted by Russell started another business in 2005 called Marshall Best Security. The company is* [*still around*](https://www.marshallbestsecurity.com/)  
*被拉塞尔，赶下台的贝斯特家族成员于 2005 年创办了另一家名为 Marshall Best Security 的公司。这家公司*[*至今仍在运营。*](https://www.marshallbestsecurity.com/)

*\-Frank Best must have spent some time selling shares in Hawaii because a number of lost shareholders resided there. Martin and his wife spent a week in Hawaii buried in obituaries at the library. “She never lets me forget that!”  
弗兰克·贝斯特肯定在夏威夷待过一段时间出售股票，因为一些失散的股东就住在那里。马丁和他的妻子在夏威夷图书馆里待了一周，埋头于讣告之中。“她让我永远忘不了这件事！”*

*\-Martin remembers one lost shareholder specifically who was being evicted from her mobile home. He wrote her a check for $40k for her Best Lock shares she had no idea she owned.  
马丁记得一位失散的股东，她当时正被赶出自己的移动房屋。他给她开了一张 4 万美元的支票，用来购买她持有的百思锁股票，而她自己根本不知道自己拥有这些股票。*

*\-The attorney working for Martin and the other dissenters on the appraisal case took a 1/3 contingency fee. After Best Lock he bought a house on Malibu Beach and retired.  
\-为马丁和其他评估案异议者工作的律师收取了三分之一的胜诉费。在百思锁之后，他在马里布海滩买了一栋房子，然后退休了。*

*\-This account is based on interviews and limited publicly available information. Any inaccuracies are unintentional. Much of this case study relies heavily on Martin’s recounting of events (verified by public documents and other shareholders, when readily available). This is especially true for the section regarding family dynamics. Walter Best was Martin’s main contact in the family.  
\-本叙述基于访谈和有限的公开信息。任何不准确之处均属无意。本案例研究很大程度上依赖于马丁对事件的叙述（如有公开文件和其他股东证实），尤其在有关家族动态的部分。沃尔特·贝斯特是马丁在家族中的主要联系人。*
